# Comp20010 practical 3

You should work through the following questions (also posted on the moodle page):

1. Start with the outline of the class in \verb|src/SinglyLinkedList.java|. Referring to the lecture notes and the book (Goodrich et al), fill in the bodies of the missing functions to implement a working Singly Linked List class which implements the List ADT.


2. The starter code in the \verb|SinglyLinkedList| class is non-generic- it is designed to hold only \verb|String|'s. Write a generic version of the Singly Linked List class.

3. Referring to the lecture notes and the book (Goodrich et al), implement a Doubly Linked List class. Once you have the Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List class working, then test them with the code in \verb|src/LinkedListTester|.

4. Describe a method which finds the middle node of a Doubly Linked List. Implement and test this method on your own implementation of the DLL.

5. Reimplement your \verb|Scoreboard| class from Tutorial 1 using a DoublyLinkedList, instead of an array.
